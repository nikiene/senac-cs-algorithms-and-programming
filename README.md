# List I

1. Write a program that asks the user to type two integers and prints the sum of these integers.

2. Write a program that asks the user to type two integers and prints the quotient and the remainder of the integer division of these integers.

   The program should print both answers in a single printf. You can assume that the user will not try to divide by zero.

3. Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and prints the square of that integer.

4. Write a program that asks the user to type the two dimensions of a rectangle and prints the perimeter and the area of that rectangle.

   The program should print both answers in a single printf.

5. Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and prints its inverse.

6. Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and prints only one number: 0 or 1.

7. Write a program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

8. Write a program that requests the weight and height values of a person, calculates and displays their BMI (Body Mass Index)

#

# List II

1. Write an algorithm that receives a number and shows a message if this number is greater than 10.

2. Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers and prints them in ascending order.

3. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. Then inform if this number is even or odd.

4. Write a program that receives an integer and informs if this number is a multiple of 10.

5. Write an algorithm that reads two distinct integer values and informs which one is greater.

6. Change the previous exercise so that it also tells you whether the numbers are the same.

#

# List III

1. Write a program that asks the user for an integer. Display an error message if the number is between 15 and 25 or between 45 and 50 (inclusive).

   Write a program that asks for a number that displays the message "SENAC" if this number is 13, 26, 42 or 70.

2. Write a program that asks the user for a number and displays a message if this number is greater than 80, less than 25 or equal to 40.

3. Write an algorithm that reads three integer values and checks if they can be the measures of the sides of a triangle.

   Property: the length of each side of a triangle is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.

4. Increment the previous exercise, in case the measures form a valid triangle, inform which type of triangle they form: equilateral, isosceles or scalene.

5. Increment the previous exercise, now informing if this is also a right triangle.

#

# List IV

1. Write a program that draws a number from 1 to 10 and gives the user two chances to get it right.

   Write a program that draws a number from 1 to 10, gives the user two chances to get it right, but informs if the drawn number is greater or less than the first guess.

   Do the same previous program, now with 3 guesses.

2. Write a program that draws two numbers from 1 to 5 and asks the user to get both numbers, not necessarily in the same order.

3. Write a program that draws two numbers from 1 to 10. Inform how many of these numbers are between 3 and 7 (inclusive).

4. Write a program that plays even or odd with the user.

#

# List V

1. Write a program that displays any complete multiplication table.

   The program should ask the user which multiplication table he wants to view, who will respond by entering a number from 1 to 10.

2. Write a program that displays the square of all numbers from 1 to 20.

3. Write a program that asks the user for 5 numbers, and for each number entered, informs whether it is even or odd.

4. Write a program that displays the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100

5. Write a program that requests 10 numbers and at the end displays the sum of all of them.

6. Write a program that asks the user for a number, and then displays all its dividers.

7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number between 10 and 20. If an invalid number is entered, ask again until a correct number is entered.

#

# List VI

1. Write a program that requests a number and then says if it is a perfect number.

2. Write a program that draws a number from 1 to 10 and gives the user two chances to get it right.

   Write a program that draws a number from 1 to 10, gives the user two chances to get it right, but informs if the drawn number is greater or less than the first guess.

   Write the same program as before, now with 3 guesses.

3. Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 25 to 200.

4. Write a program that requests the code and height of 5 athletes.

   At the end of the data entry, inform the HEIGHT of the tallest athlete.

5. Write a program that requests the code and height of 5 athletes.

   At the end of the data entry, inform the CODE of the tallest athlete.

   Also inform the average height of these 5 athletes.

   Do not restrict data entry to only 5 athletes.

   Now after including each athlete the program should ask the user if they want to include another.

   The answer is given with (0/1). The program continues to show the CODE of the tallest, and the average height.
